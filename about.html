        <h2>Hello, </h2>
        <h3>My name is Pearl and when I am done with this bootcamp I will be a software engineer.</h3>
        <p>Prior to deciding that I needed a change in my career path, I currently work as a Program Assistant( teacher Assistant). 
        I have worked as a program assistant for the last 17 years. Although, I do love what I do; it is without a doubt, time for 
        a change.</p>
        <p>I have five children ranging from the age of 24 to 5. I enjoy spending my time with my family. During my spare time, I 
        love to run as well as workout. I enjoy a good book from time to time. I love anything homemade, I guess you can say I enjoy
        crafts. I love to scrapbook basically anything. Lastly, I enjoy baking cookies as well doing puzzles. </p>
